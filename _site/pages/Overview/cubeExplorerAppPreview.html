<h1 id="cube-explorer">Cube Explorer</h1>
<p>The Cube Explorer App is the Swiss army knife application of Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>. As described in the <a href="architecture.html#message-trays">Architecture Overview</a>, Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> stores device data in a JSON object called a tray. Name-value pairs inside the tray are called cubes. Besides storing values, each cube also contains a unit description and an alarm block.</p>

<p>The Cube Explorer is a user configurable app to read and/or set any combination of cubes from any set of trays that the user has access rights to view. The app also permits the user to set the alarm block configuration of the cube. The user can plot real time data from the cubes or look at the archived history of the cubes. The archived history can also be downloaded into csv format files for off-line analysis. The user can also save multiple personalized cube configurations.</p>
