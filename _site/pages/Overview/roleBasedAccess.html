<h1 id="role-based-access">Role Based Access</h1>
<p>App authentication is used to keep intruders out of a Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> control system which is very important. However, making sure that authenticated users do not do something unintentionally is probably more critical. In Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>, this accomplished with role-based-access. Most control systems implement only reading and setting privileges but with Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> is possible to restrict not only what actions are permitted by what applications are allowed to be accessed. In addition, because Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> groups data into <a href="/pages/Overview/architecture.html#message-trays">message trays</a>, it is also possible to restrict which data a user has access to as well. Below shows an example user profile for Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> role-based-access.</p>
