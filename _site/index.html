<h1 id="blinky-litetm">Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup></h1>
<p><strong>Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup></strong>  is a full-stack, integrated hardware-software control platform based on Edge computing technology designed by hardware engineers that can perform at any scale from home automation to particle accelerators.</p>

<p><strong>Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup></strong> was developed at the MaxIV Synchrotron Light Source and the European Spallation Source both located in Lund, Sweden. In this world of complex and costly particle accelerators, <span style="color:#ff6100"><strong><em>a strong 24/7 maintenance mindset is a must</em></strong></span>. It is essential to always understand the state of a machine remotely and to be able to securely troubleshoot it efficiently from anywhere in the world at any time.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff6100"><strong>Thatâ€™s why we developed Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup></strong></span></p>
