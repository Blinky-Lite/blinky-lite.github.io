# Application Server
The Application Server (or Blinky-Lite Box) requires [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) as services which can be difficult to install so we have bundled the Blinky-Lite Box in a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/blinkylite/blinky-lite-box) container. Then we have developed Docker Compose yaml files for retrieving and starting the Blinky-Lite Box with all the required services. The [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is easily installed on Linux systems. For operating systems other than Linux you will need to use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
