# App Style Sheets
## Application Examples
Every application in a Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> project can have its own cascading style sheet (CSS) to define the look and feel of the application. These style sheets are stored in the database as a [JSON object](/pages/Overview/styleSheets.html#app-style-sheet-json). There can be as many style sheets as the user would like and a given style sheet can be shared by a number of applications.
