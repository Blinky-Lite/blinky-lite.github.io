# Logbook
For streamlined functionality, the logbook is text-only. We believe that commercial note taking applications should be used for image capturing. Since all settings are logged, the purpose of the logbook application is to serve as a forum to explain rationale behind changes to the control system parameters. Logbook entries can be searched by date and author. Additions or changes to the logbook are sent to the [NTFY](notifySystem.html) system with the following formats
 - logbook
 - logbook-<i>author</i>
 - logbook-<i>author</i>-<i>action</i> where actions are:
   - added
   - edited
   - deleted
