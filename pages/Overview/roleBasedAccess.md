# Role Based Access
App authentication is used to keep intruders out of a Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> control system which is very important. However, making sure that authenticated users do not do something unintentionally is probably more critical. In Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>, this accomplished with role-based-access. Most control systems implement only reading and setting privileges but with Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> is possible to restrict not only what actions are permitted by what applications are allowed to be accessed. In addition, because Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> groups data into [message trays](/pages/Overview/architecture.html#message-trays), it is also possible to restrict which data a user has access to as well. Below shows an example user profile for Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> role-based-access.
