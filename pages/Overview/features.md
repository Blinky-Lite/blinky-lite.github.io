# Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> Features
- ## Mobility
  Most other control platforms sit behind a firewall and remote access is an afterthought. Not with **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>**. Secure remote access was the paramount requirement from the start. All **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>** applications are web apps that can be securely accessed from anywhere in the world. Web apps require no installation and you are always guaranteed to get the latest version.
