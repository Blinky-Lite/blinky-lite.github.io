# Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup> Features
- ## Mobility!
  Most other control platforms sit behind a firewall and remote access is an afterthought. Not with **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>**. Secure remote access was the paramount requirement from the start. All **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>** applications are web apps that can be securely accessed from anywhere in the world. Web apps require no installation and you are always guaranteed to get the latest version. 
- ## Security
  **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>** connections are always initiated from within your facility, not from the outside, providing secure information flow from you to the machine/sensor and back. All **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>** mobile apps require two factor authentication, ensuring that only the right people have access.
- ## Flexibility
  **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>** can be added independently or on top of any existing control system

  Every single line of the **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>** codebase is version-controlled and open allowing  **Blinky-Lite<sup>TM</sup>** to grow with you.
